## OneTrust for Angular
OneTrust loader & wrapper for Angular

#### How to use?
1. Install the package  
   `npm i @altack/ngx-onetrust`

   Notice that this library will not add any OneTrust related dependency, OneTrust scripts will be loaded at runtime.

2. Import the `OneTrustModule.forRoot()` in your `AppModule`.

   A configuration object with your **domainScriptID** and **cookiesGroups** needs to be set as module configuration.
   CookiesGroups usually looks as follows but their IDs (C0001,C0002, etc. ) might be different.
    ```javascript
        OneTrustModule.forRoot({
          cookiesGroups: {
            StrictlyNecessaryCookies: 'C0001',
            PerformanceCookies: 'C0002',
            FunctionalCookies: 'C0003',
            TargetingCookies: 'C0004',
            SocialMediaCookies: 'C0005'
          },
          domainScript: 'your-domain-script-id'
        })
    ```  

   Visit your https://app.cookiepro.com/cookies/categorizations?tab=Categories to define the CookiesGroups object properly.

4. Now you can inject the `OneTrustService` (usually during the `APP_INITIALIZER`) to load the OneTrust scripts, change the banner language in realtime and listen for consent changes.
   Let's have a look these 3 method in detail.

    - `oneTrustService.loadOneTrust()` accepts an optional parameter with your `domainScriptID` which will take over the one defined at the module level.
      Calling this method will init the download and initialization of the OneTrust script.

    - `oneTrustService.showPreferences()` will open the OneTrust Preference Center dialog.

    - `oneTrustService.translateBanner(lang)` will try to translate the cookie banner using the lang parameter (e.g `en`, `es`, `pl`, etc.).
      It works by calling the `OneTrust.changeLanguage()` method from the OneTrust object of the browser. In order for this to work, you'll have to define the translation in the OneTrust administration panel (usually in the Templates section).
      Based on the country the user is, `translateBanner()` will attempt to create a valid locale (e.g en-US) by combining the language + the country.
      You can also pass a second argument `true` to the `oneTrustService.translateBanner('en', true)` in order to force a language change without trying to build the locale.

    - `oneTrustService.consentChanged$()` returns an `Observable<Map<CookiesGroups, boolean>>`. Basically a Map with the permission the user has consent. Useful for running certain logic based on the user selection. Heads up, by default (while the cookie banner is visible and pristine) this `Map` will contain only `StrictlyNecessaryCookies` permission.

    - `oneTrustService.oneTrustInstance$()` returns an `Observable<OneTrust>`. An instance of the `OneTrust` object after it has been loaded.


#### Side notes
A common use case for loading `OneTrust` is by calling `oneTrustService.loadOneTrust()` within the `APP_INITIALIZER`.
```javascript
    {
      provide: APP_INITIALIZER,
      useFactory: appInitializer,
      deps: [MyInitService],
      multi: true
    }
```

```javascript
export function appInitializer(myInitService: MyInitService): Function {
  return () => myInitService.load();
}
```

```javascript
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class MyInitService {

  constructor(
    ...
    private oneTrust: OneTrustService,
    ...
  ) {}

  public load(): Promise<any> {
  this.oneTrust.loadOneTrust();
  ...
  }
}
```

#### Angular Compatibility
If you're using Angular 13 make sure to use 1.3.x versions
